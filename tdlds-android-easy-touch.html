                            <p> I just picked up my nex 2019 CX5 and got my phone connected with android auto, but it seems to have some bizarre limitations. Firstly, the car's touchscreen is disabled in android auto, even when the car is parked. I can scroll through the pressable buttons with the big knob, but nada on the touchscreen. The touchscreen works fine for factory radio/navigation. Secondly, when in android auto, the only option I can select is navigation. The music and phone icons are on the display 
I'm going to buy the 8+. Any tips and tricks you guys wanna share? Any apps that I should check out that are exclusive to Apple? I'm nervous, but excited to switch. I could barely get past the first generator you crank. I'm looking to buy a tablet but also want to make sure its compatible/has a decent layout with the uworld app (buying uworld for step 3). Any suggestions. 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blk.smarttouch What is Smart Touch? Smart Touch is an easy touch, assistive touch tool with a floating ball (called in another way as quick ball) on the screen. You can easily use frequent function of Android, Smart Touch is also an ideal app to protect the physical buttons (home button, back button, power button) like assistive touch. When you enable assistive permission, Smart touch will turn out to be assistive touch. It supports Screen. Hello, My specific example is Lego Scooby Doo. I just bought a Shield TV, and while my son likes the game, it's hard for him to play with the virtual touch controls on my phone. Is there a way to force that game to use a controller even if it's not compatible? Thanks. For example, we often read here that something is or isn't possible, such as catching a raid boss on the last ball, or getting a curveball bonus while hitting in a certain quadrant. What's the easiest or best way to record our game to provide proof of what we saw? It seems like the best, most concise videos here are gif files, so that'd be extra good. I'm personally on Android, but this would probably also be helpful unless it's obvious for users with iPhones. I really want to see android devs porting it to other phones, is this feasible. 
Hey there. Long time Foobar User. I am wondering if there is a possibility to dedicate foobar to a mini (like 7") monitor next to the main monitor. I am thinking about getting a touchscreen for my rig where i can control foobar from directly. Also i am sure i can find a way to make the play/pause/other buttons appear larger so i can actually click then with my finger. is there a way to attach foobar as "sticky" to one special monitor? also i need to have my mouse cursor to stay where I am really hoping the Switch has more app support like music, video, e-reader, etc. The 3DS has Netflix and Youtube and building off of that would be a huge plus in my eyes. Any chance Buy the client as it currently stands, including the source, and tweak it, by all means. But developing a new client from the ground up is a fool's errand with a small community like this, an endless time suck. There are so many better ways to focus your efforts for a revival I've never had a car mount before and finally decided to get one for my Pixel. I searched tons of websites and all over Amazon trying to find ones that would not block the Pixel's power or volume buttons at all. I ordered and received two from Amazon to try them out and then realized both of them block the finger print sensor in the back. I like the smaller mount and the way it holds the pixel diagonally by the corners but with the bigger mount I would be able to mark the mount where the finger. I understand that all the hype is on MH4U right now but I recently got MHFU for my phone and I couldn't be happier. I think the controls might be better than they were for the PSP. Its so smooth and I can't stop picking it up. I had low hopes just because virtual controls suck usually but damn this game pulls Hello, Since I'd like to use an ereader instead of thick books I am looking for one, as cheap as possible. I doesn't matter at all what it's features are, the only thing that matters is that I can put ePub files on it to read. I searched for one but it didn't come under 0, do you have suggestions? Thank you P.S. maybe this question has been asked many times, please do reference me to the tread or site if that's the case Edit: if anyone's interested, or might be in the future in this thread. </p>

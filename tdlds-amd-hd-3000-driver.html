Does anyones knows how can I recover the resolution, or the previous driver? AMD doesn't provide support for Win 10 drivers with this integrated.

Everything seems to be running smoothly except I am unable to get audio from the 3.5 mm jacks in the front and back (green port). I confirmed that audio does come through a USB headset I have, but I am not sure why I can't hear anything when I plug in my 3.5 mm jack headphones.

Late last week word began circulating that AMD would be dropping driver support for their DX10 generation GPUS - HD 2000, HD 3000, and HD 4000 - based on a Phoronix article discussing the future of driver support for those GPUs under Linux.

My last GPU from team red was not even a AMD, it was an ATi. The almighty HD 5870, best of its generation with features that nVidia didn't have at that time. Before the HD 5870 I had a Geforce 8600 GT and later on a GTX 780 (died btw. RIP), which was my last GPU. My rig is: i5 8600K + 16 GB DDR4 3000. nVidia lost its mind selling RTX 2070 for 500 USD (you can consider yourself lucky if you find them for this price anyway.)

                            <p> Been using iOS for the last 6 years, now I have to switch to Android. Most of the stuff I got under control but mail is my biggest issue, as I use it a lot. I have 3 accounts that I use daily. So what app would you guys recommend? Phone will be either Sony or Samsung if that makes any difference. Hey dudes, I was using my Samsung mini usb drive on my Android Tablet (Honeycomb 3.2.1) and the drive stopped working on my pc. Every time I connect my Samsung external drive to my pc, now I get a BSOD, but it still connects to my tablet just fine. :s Here's the info: Problem signature: Problem Event Name: BlueScreen OS Version: 6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.1 Locale ID: 1033 Additional information about the problem: BCCode: 50 BCP1: FFFFF98004DC0000 BCP2: 0000000000000000 BCP3: FFFFF8800. Ok, so sure, and blatant product plug but whatever. I've got a fair few email accounts for work. Each different job has a different account(Same over all job, just jobs within it) and personal emails and so on. I found that I was spending a huge part of the day flicking between each of the accounts and checking for mail that wasn't there. Set up Outlook last night and this morning, holly moly. Emails coming in from all accounts, into one place. Reply. Send. Done. If your getting. I've been using Linux for a while, sticking mostly with Ext3 partitions on my boxes. My next box, I'd like to put a bit of variety in the filesystems I use. What are the differences in the various filesystem types available for Linux 
Hi all, I have a personal email account using Absolute-email ( of Firstname@Lastname.org.uk I am trying to set up this account to my Andriod (Samsung Galaxy s2) with the same settings that worked fine on my iPhone (the settings that the website say will work) but nothing happens. The settings are: Username: Firstname@lastname.org.uk Password: Use POP3 Account Incoming mail server: Mail.Lastname.org.uk Port: 110 No SSL Outgoing # Background: We've been offered LOS 16 GSIs in the past (see XDA), but they haven't been updated in quite a while, so as a LineageOS lover, I decided to step up and do it myself. Turns out it wasn't so easy - there were a number of hurdles that prevented it from building properly, booting or being feature-complete. But here I am, having figured out most if not all what's needed, and verified booting on an arm64 ab device I own, I'm ready to share my findings ~~as well as a build~~ (sorry I was running for the bus today, and my phone fell out of my pocket. I realized what happened and the bus driver let me off before the next stop. I ran back to retrace my steps. Some nice people on the street called my phone for me, but it went to voice mail. On the corner close to where I suspect I lost it is a restaurant popular with neighborhood kids. I went in to look around to see if anyone was checking out my phone. I overheard a group talking about finding something, and selling Vorrei creare insieme a voi una lista "collaborativa" di APP che secondo gli utenti di r/italy ogni persona dovrebbe avere nel proprio telefono per migliorare i più disparati ambiti della vita di tutti i giorni .

Greetings, I am not entirely certain how to summarize in a concise way the issue in the title but bare with me as I do my best explain the peculiar problem I am facing at the moment. # Specs and configuration First and foremost the specs, I am using Dell XPS 13 (9370) with the following configuration 4k Intel Core i7-8550U 16GB of RAM Intel UHD 620 graphics 512GB SSD The OS is, of course, Archlinux rocking KDE plasma: KDE Plasma Version: 5.13.5 KDE Frameworks Version:.

Last night I made two transactions, and they were time limited, so I used "priority" fee in the standard (old) Android wallet. First confirmation in about 10-15 mins for both. It "worked". Checked this morning, looked at the fees, calculated them back into USD. eyepop. fumes. The first transaction was 223 bytes. The fee was .93. The second transaction was 226 bytes. The fee was .55. This is OUTRAGEOUS. Total failure. I am currently using Windows 10 64Bit Professional with Ubuntu 18.04. I am not using LLVM. I previously used Ubuntu 16.04 on this very same hard disk, and it was blazing fast. However, at that time I was using Intel i3 530 with a "meagre" 8GB RAM. Now after getting Ryzen 1700 with 16GB RAM, I installed Ubuntu 18.04 which has excruciatingly slow startup times. I ran systemd-analyze time, and this was the output: `Startup finished in 24.573s (firmware) + 4.757s (loader) + 6.012s (kernel) I thought someone could benefit from this post, maybe discover a new app or discover an alternative.

Not a modern TV with HDMI port but a crt TV. So I bought a HDMI to av converter which is powered by my RPI3's USB  Nothing else was connected to the USB ports. It was a 16 GB SD card and I used to transfer movies directly into it by sftp or samba. (I think I should have bought a USB flash drive) 2-Pi-hole: it worked liked a champ. But I suspect that it does a lot of writing to the USB , right ?!  I mean all the packets going through it and the quarry. 
With privacy and elegance in mind, here's a list of apps that you might want to use as an alternative to some of the shady apps that are out there. Most have Play Store links, but a few need to be downloaded from F-Droid (you can download the APK directly or via the F-Droid client (https://f-droid.org/) ). My criteria for this list was: 1. Open-source 1. Material Design Granted, a few of the apps do not follow the Material Design guidelines, but given the alternatives, I think they shoul. Finally picked one up one a trade-in credit and have been quite surprised. One file on a flash drive (enable_ssh.txt (blank)) gets copied over on boot and you then have a root shell. # whoami root # uname -a Linux steamlink-87F1 3.8.13-mrvl #52 PREEMPT Thu Sep 1 11:23:18 PDT 2016 armv7l GNU/Linux # cat /proc/cpuinfo processor : 0 model name : ARMv7 Processor rev 0 (v7l) BogoMIPS : 995.32 Features : swp half thumb fastmult I have a Moto G5+ and up until today everything was working great. I've had a 128GB micro SD mounted as internal storage for a couple of months and it's showed no signs of issues. Today after a reboot to change SIM cards, the phone has failed to recognise the SD card. The storage tab in settings marks it as corrupt and asks me to reformat it. I've tried looking at the card in Linux. The SD has a primary 17MB partition formatted as vfat, and a secondary partition Problem: My wife gave me a cheap Chinese MicroSD card that she ordered from China. The card is sold as, labeled as, and detected by computers as 128GB, but it is actually 8GB. Story: I installed RetroPie on the card, set it up, added NES and SNES ROMs, and used it for a few days. Today I decided to add some PSX roms, and my FTP client would disconnect part way through transferring the new ROMS. When I checked the Pi it was frozen. If I rebooted, I would get a screen that scrolled Reading through the rest of the threads here, I see quite a few people asking what the point of a UMPC is. I wanted to start a thread documenting example use cases for those on the fence. The main purpose of a UMPC, in my mind, is to have an "EDC" computer - every day carry. You keep it in your daypack/purse or cargos pocket; you do wear cargos, right? ;) It provides significant capability that you don't have to plan in advance for; it's just always there if you need it, even in places you'd. Found a discussion on The Verge forums, and decided to post on reddit to see what you guys use. Whenever people talk about apps, it's usually a select few that get mentioned (probably whatever is in the top ten most downloaded), so what apps do you use that people don't know about but should? One that I recently found was Flow For Reddit (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deeptrouble.yaarreddit) and it's honestly one of the best reddit apps that I have found. Edit: added. Draw up a stool and a glass of your favourite rotgut, TFTS, and I'll tell you a tale - a tale of not-so-long-ago, in a land not-so-far-away. I'll warn you now, this tale has some heft to it. One of the first things that struck me as odd about my current position was that all of the business critical applications were developed by a third party contractor. While his ability to provide support was okay for the first year, this dropped off sharply as time passed. The next thing that struck.
